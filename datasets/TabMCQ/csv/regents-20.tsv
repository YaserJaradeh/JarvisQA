ENERGY Form of engery		EVENT Abstract description of event involving energy		ENERGY SOURCE 	CONDITION A condition that must be satisfied		CONSEQUENCE The result of the energy source, given the condition
a magnetic field	can	attract iron	; for example, if	a permanent magnet	is near a steel nail	then	the nail will move towards the magnet
electrical energy	can	be changed to sound energy	; for example, if	an electrical signal	enters the speaker of a telephone 	then	the speaker will convert the electrical signals into speech
electrical energy	can	produce light and sound	; for example, if	a bolt of lightning	strikes a tree	then	there will be a bright flash and a loud noise
electricity	can	be converted to light	; for example, if	a battery	is connected with wires to a light bulb	then	the bulb will glow with light
friction	can	cause heat	; for example, if	a speeding car	skids its tires on a road	then	the skidding will cause the tires to become hot
friction	can	slow an object moving along a surface	; for example, if	a rolling ball	is moving on flat ground 	then	the ball will slow and eventually halt
friction	can	slow an object moving along a surface	; for example, if	a rolling ball	is rolling through thick grass 	then	the ball will slow and quickly come to a halt
gravity	can	pull one object towards another	; for example, if	a person	throws a ball up into the air	then	the Earth will pull the ball back down
gravity	can	pull an object downwards	; for example, if	a marble	is dropped into a glass of water	then	the marble will fall to the bottom of the glass
gravity	can	pull an object downwards	; for example, if	a ball	is released in the air with no support 	then	the ball will fall to the ground
gravity	can	pull an object downwards	; for example, if	a rock	is released at the top of a hill 	then	the rock will roll down the hill
heat energy	can	be transferred from one location to another	; for example, if	a stove	heats a kettle of water 	then	the heat will move from the stove to the water
heat energy	can	be changed to sound energy	; for example, if	a kettle with a whistle	is used to boil water	then	the kettle will make a whistling sound as the steam from the boiling water escapes from the kettle's spout
high friction	can	cause an object to move slow	; for example, if	a bicycle 	is moving on a rough road 	then	the bicycle will move slowly
light	can	cause heat	; for example, if	bright sunlight	shines on asphalt	then	the asphalt will become hot
light energy	can	be reflected by an object	; for example, if	a flashlight	shines on a mirror	then	the light from the flashlight will bounce off the mirror
light energy	can	be changed to sound energy	; for example, if	a radio wave	is received by a radio 	then	the radio will convert the radio wave into sound
low friction	can	allow an object to move fast	; for example, if	a bicycle	is moving on a smooth road 	then	the bicycle will move fast
magnetic energy	can	produce motion	; for example, if	a compass needle	is allowed to rotate freely	then	the compass needle will turn until it points north
magnetism	can	cause motion	; for example, if	a magnet	is waved near a pile of steel nails 	then	the nails will move
magnetism	can	attract iron	; for example, if	a magnet	is moved towards a pile of iron nails 	then	the nails will move as the magnet comes closer
mechanical energy	can	be converted to sound energy	; for example, if	a pianist	strikes a piano key	then	the piano will make a musical sound
mechanical energy	can	be used to move something from on location to another	; for example, if	a worker	applies a shovel to a pile of dirt	then	the dirt will move
mechanical energy	can	be used to move something from on location to another	; for example, if	a baseball player	throws a baseball	then	the baseball will move away from the player
mechanical energy	can	be changed to sound energy	; for example, if	a baby	shakes a rattle	then	the rattle will make a noise
mechanical energy	can	produce motion	; for example, if	a person	pushes a wooden block on a floor	then	the block will move across the floor
motion of a liquid against a solid	can	cause erosion of the solid	; for example, if	the ocean's waves	are pounding against the coast	then	the waves will wash away some of the coastal soil
sound	can	cause vibration	; for example, if	a lound sound	occurs near a wooden door	then	the door will vibrate
sound energy	can	move through air	; for example, if	two people 	are having a converstation at a table	then	sound is moving through the air between them
