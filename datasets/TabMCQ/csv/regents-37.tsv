Abstract description	Concrete example
different plants have different life spans	apple trees can live for many years but bean plants usually live for only a few months
plants depend on other plants	shade-loving plants such as leafy greens and squash depend on taller vegetables such as corn to provide shade
plants produce many offspring	one pigweed plant can produce half a million seeds
seasonal changes help plants grow	day length changes initiate growth and flowering and also let the plant know when to start to prepare for winter dormancy
